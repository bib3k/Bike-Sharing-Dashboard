# London Bike Sharing Data Analysis
This repository contains code and visualizations for the analysis of London bike sharing data. We utilized the Kaggle API to programmatically download the dataset and conducted data exploration, assessment, and manipulation using Python and the Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook. The cleaned dataset was exported to an Excel file named "London_Bikes_Cleaned.xlsx".

## Python Code Summary:
The London bike sharing dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, extracts the downloaded zip file, reads it into a Pandas DataFrame, performs data cleaning and preprocessing including renaming columns, normalizing humidity, and mapping weather and season categories, and finally exports the cleaned dataset to an Excel file named "london_bikes_cleaned.xlsx".

## Data Source:
